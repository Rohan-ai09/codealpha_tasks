EDA is the first step in data analysis, helping you uncover insights
and identify key patterns in your dataset. It allows you to explore
what questions to ask before diving into detailed analysis. This
process can be done independently or alongside data cleaning.
During EDA, you will:
Ask meaningful questions about the data.
Identify the underlying structure of the dataset.
Detect trends, patterns, and anomalies.
Test hypotheses and validate assumptions.
Explore potential problems that can be solved using the data
